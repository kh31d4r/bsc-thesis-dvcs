	Our proposed topic for the thesis is distributed version control and 
	feasible workflows relating to this. Version control and source control
	management is an important task in software engineering as, and the tools
	used can make the experience more or less enjoyable. The current trend
	within source control management is to have the version control system
	to be distributed, without a central authority (at least not a central
	authority imposed by the system itself). It is not unusual to use 
	distributed version control system in a centralized way, but the 
	opportunity to use it decentralized is interesting. 

	Within our project we are trying to enforce a distributed workflow, and
	it would be interesting to learn what the benefits are, what are the
	obstacles, and how we are going to implement this.
