\section{Background}

Our proposed topic for the thesis is distributed version control systems
(DVCS) and feasible workflows relating to this. Version control and
source control management (SCM) is an important task in software
engineering, and the tools used determines if it will become an
obstruction rather than the convenience that it probably was intended to
be. One of the current trends within source control management is to
have the version control system be distributed\cite{sink10}, without a
central authority (at least not a central authority imposed by the
system itself).

According to a survey among users of the Eclipse IDE\cite{eclipse10}, the 
rise of one such system --- git --- has increased from 2.4\% to 6.8\% from 
2009 to 2010. And it is not the only DVCS with a steep increase in usage: 
Mercurial increased from 1.1\% to 3\% over the same period of time. 
DVCS tools are especially popular within the open source community, 
with large projects, such as the Linux kernel\cite{kernel-git}, 
Gnome\cite{gnome-git} and Firefox\cite{firefox-hg} using them.

It is not unusual to use distributed version control system in a 
centralized way, but the opportunity to use it decentralized is 
interesting. Within our project we are trying to enforce a distributed 
workflow, and it would be interesting to learn what the benefits are, 
what are the obstacles, and how we are going to implement this. It is
important to evaluate the benefit from this workflow and document the
experience gained from its use in the project.

\section{Research Questions}

We will try to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do the developers adapt to this workflow? 
	\item How does this workflow affect software quality?
\end{itemize}

The outcome will be an evaluation of distributed VCS workflows, with
interviews of developers and data from the project. The data will
consist of repository metadata (commits, commitdiffs, etc.). This
contribution will be useful as a prestudy for others interested in
deploying this type of workflow and as a reference for organizations or
researchers interested in deploying other type of workflows.

\section{Research Methodology}

To answer our research questions, we will conduct post-mortem interviews
with project team members and participants in other projects within the
same course. We will question them on their experience with version
control and how they perceive version control concepts. We will also do
literature studies within the field of version control and configuration
management. In addition to this we will analyze meta data associated
with the VCS repository (e.g. number of commits, number of commits per
author, number of merges, size of commits).
